The police would not estimate how many were marching, but at midday a plaza that could hold 5,000 people had overflowed. As the march moved toward the Capitol, thousands more demonstrators poured in from side streets to form a mobile mass of puffy coats, strollers, posters and spontaneous prayer groups.

“I’m marching for everyone’s sons and daughters,” said Esaw Garner, the widow of Eric Garner, who died in Staten Island when an officer placed him in a chokehold. Samaria Rice, the mother of 12-year-old Tamir, said, “To the police force: Don’t shoot our children. To the all the families who experience the same pain as me: We will have justice.” Her son was shot and killed by a police officer in Cleveland because he was waving a gun that turned out to be a toy that fired plastic pellets.

The march follows protests around the country over recent grand jury decisions not to indict the officer who shot Mr. Brown in Ferguson, Mo., or the one who placed Mr. Garner in a fatal hold in Staten Island.

On Friday, the death of Tamir, the 12-year-old Cleveland boy, was formally ruled a homicide, according to a county autopsy report; he died in November when an officer shot him within seconds of arriving on the scene.

Protesters have occupied parks, city streets, train stations and retail stores to draw attention to the use of force by police. Thousands of people in New York tried to close major roads, bridges and tunnels, and disrupt the rhythms of the city. In Berkeley, Calif., an Amtrak train was forced to stop, a central freeway was closed for hours, and regional commuter trains were halted.

The National Park Service said sponsors of today’s march in Washington, which this year was called Justice for All March, had sought a permit for 5,000 protesters. Many protesters were organized by the American Civil Liberties Union, branches of the N.A.A.C.P. and various labor, civil rights and religious groups.

Protesters gathered at the Freedom Plaza near the National Mall; the march was to end near the Capitol, where Mr. Sharpton was expected to call for congressional hearings into the deaths in New York and Ferguson, and lay out a legislative agenda concerning police conduct. The Justice Department is investigating the deaths in both cities, but the organizers want the department to have broader powers over killings by police officers.
Correction: December 13, 2014

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Trayvon Martin was killed by a police officer. He was shot by a civilian, not an officer.

An earlier version of this correction misspelled Trayvon Martin’s name.
